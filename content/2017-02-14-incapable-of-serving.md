title: Incapable of serving
---
From the opinion pages of *The New York Times* yesterday, 13 of February, 2017, also appearing in print today. Some emphasis mine.

> Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an *inability to tolerate views different from his own*, leading to **rage reactions**. His words and behavior suggest a **profound inability to empathize**. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).
> 
> In a powerful leader, these attacks are **likely to increase**, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him **incapable of serving** safely as president.

That, of course, is nothing new it as it has been [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/) before, [more](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/12/bernie-sanders-calls-trump-a-pathological-liar-al-franken-says-a-few-republicans-think-trump-is-mentally-ill/) than one time.
