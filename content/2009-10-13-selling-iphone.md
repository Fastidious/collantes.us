In an effort to start saving money towards an Android based device (would love HTC Hero), I am selling my <a href="http://ur1.in/2">2G 16GB iPhone</a>. As the eBay listing reads, it is a very well kept, 2G 16GB iPhone, unlocked and jailbroken. No scratches, no blemishes. Bid starts at $1, no reserve. Yes, $1.
