> News broke this morning that Senator Clinton made three separate loans to her campaign in the past 30 days ---including one as recently as Monday.
> 
> These loans total more than $6.4 million, which combined with her previous personal loans, add up to at least $11.4 million she's loaned her campaign since February.
> 
> A spokesman said she may continue to "loan the campaign additional money out of her jointly-held assets" ---which include more than $100 million in income since her husband left the White House.

How can she loan money to herself? Isn't Hillary Clinton's campaign, hers?
