> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24251043/">Clinton wins in Pennsylvania</a> -- NBC News projected Tuesday night that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had won Pennsylvania's presidential primary, a victory that analysts said she had to have if she were to remain a credible candidate for the Democratic nomination.

I find it incredible how she has been able to get as many votes as she has. But after seeing McCain take over the Republican's vote I should have expected anything. My hopes, though, <a href="/2008/01/29/i-will-vote/">are still intact</a>.
