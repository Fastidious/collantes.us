John McCain on [religion](http://www.beliefnet.com/story/220/story_22001_1.html "John McCain on religion.").

> "I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles...personally, I prefer someone who I know who has a solid grounding in my faith...I think the number one issue people should make [in the] selection of the President of the United States is, 'Will this person carry on in the Judeo Christian principled tradition that has made this nation the greatest experiment in the history of mankind?'"

I am starting to doubt on whether or not McCain and Bush are related. I would swear they are. Do you want another Bush?
