I have grown tired of deleting bogus accounts. They do not do anything, they do not cause harm; it is just tiresome to delete, each day, 20 or 30 of them. So enough... for now. Those who had an account (which was created using OpenID), still can comment, but no new registrations anymore.

As a matter of fact... I think I will change this site completely. Soon... ish.
