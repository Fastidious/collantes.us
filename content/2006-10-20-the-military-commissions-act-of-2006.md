<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wu">David Wu</a>, democratic congressman representing the state of Oregon reportedly said, referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Commissions_Act_of_2006">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> recently signed into law:

> Let us say that my wife, who is here in the gallery with us tonight, a sixth generation Oregonian, is walking by the friendly, local military base and is picked up as an unlawful enemy combatant. What is her recourse? She says, I am a U.S. citizen. That is a jurisdictional fact under this statute, and she will not have recourse to the courts? She can take it to Donald Rumsfeld, but she cannot take it across the street to an article 3 court.
