Well, I have finally moved to my own collocated server. I know you saw nothing here for a while, then you probably saw some errors and now we are finally back, running smoothly, we want to think.

This new server is connected to a faster pipe, so you should see an improvement: pages should load faster and site availability should be around 98 or 99%. That's about it!

There are a few things to left to do, so off I go. I will return later, hopefully with much more interesting things to say ;-) Have a nice weekend everyone!
