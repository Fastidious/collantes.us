It has been a quiet time here. But quiet here does not means it has been so everywhere else. It has been stressful, it has been painful. It hasn't been easy. Whoever once said --or wrote-- that life isn't easy wasn't lying. But as uneasy as it might get, it is worth living it.

I will be back, right after <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT1%2Bshtml/201440.shtml">Jeanne</a> has passed.
