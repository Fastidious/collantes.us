[Steve Jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) [commencement
address](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html) at
[Stanford University](http://stanford.edu/), in 2005:

> Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve
> ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because
> almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
> embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of
> death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are
> going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
> have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not
> to follow your heart.

and,

> Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
> Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other
> people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out
> your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow
> your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly
> want to become. Everything else is secondary.

The [whole
text](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html) is
very nice, a good read and (for now) timeless.
