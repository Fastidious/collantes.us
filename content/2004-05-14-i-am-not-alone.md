Looks like I am not the only one making the move. Judging by the length of the <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml#trackback" title="Trackbacks on It's about Time">trackback list</a> on "Mena's Corner", a whole lot of people is moving away from Movable Type. Since the news has bee Slashdotted, the WP server is overloaded by, not only switchers, but /. visitors. I am sure they will survive. Now ready for the weekend!

Even <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0" title="Freedom 0">Mark Pilgrim</a> switched! The world is coming to an end :-)
