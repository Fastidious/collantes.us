![Mi Viejo](/resources/2010-11-26-mi-viejo.jpg#full "Mi viejo")

A steady, yet gentle, rain was falling over Miami on the night of November 24th, 2010. Some say rain are tears from the sky. I was crying as well. On November 24th my father died.

Those who have lost an infinitely dear one will understand how I feel. Not only did I lose the best father a son could have, I lost a lifetime friend, a restless protector, a confidant. The many memories that I have of him continue to bring tears. It hurts so much!

This entry is just another way I have to bring homage to him. My memories of him will one day die with me; until then I will never, ever, forget him.

**February XX, 19XX -- November 24th, 2010**
