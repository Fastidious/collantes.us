Back in 2011 was the last time [I wrote](/2011/05/13/upcoming-presidential-elections/) about Presidential Elections (2012). I can't believe we are about to get into them again. In 2012 I knew exactly who to vote for, but in 2016, with the [selection we have](http://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2016) thus far, I really have no idea about who is the most viable---if there is one. Certainly *not* [this one](http://ballotpedia.org/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2016):

"Is The American Dream dead?" They are asking me the question, "Is the American Dream dead?" And the American Dream is in trouble. That I can tell you. OK? It's in trouble. But we're going to get it back and do some real jobs. How about the man with that beautiful red hat? Stand up! Stand up! What a hat!"
