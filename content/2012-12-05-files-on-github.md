There is a new feautre on GitHub, and this one allows you to create files directly from the web interface. This is very handy, for those of us running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

This is my first test of the feature, I had to try it right away. Only wishing now to have a friendlier Markdown/kramdown editor. But it's a start. I like it!
