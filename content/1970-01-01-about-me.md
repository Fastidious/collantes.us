### Ego

Hi there, welcome! You are now browsing my personal blog. In here I write about whatever happens to interest me from time to time. I am a father and a husband living in [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida), [FL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida), [U.S.A.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)

I have worked for the Florida Educational System as a [system administrator][21] (sysadmin) since June of 1996 or whereabouts, but **nothing** on this site is affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by them.

### About the site

The pages of this website are generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and managed with [Git][9]. They are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Contacting me

You can reach me via [e-mail][11], and [SMS/iMessage][16]. If you wish to encrypt your email, here is [the file](/resources/dc_key.asc) containing my public PGP key (EdDSA). You can verify the fingerprint of it by running ```dig``` and listing the ```TXT``` records for ```collantes.us``` in a shell. My [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) public key is also on a ```TXT``` record on ```collantes.us```.
