Google is well known for altering its homepage logos to commemorate a <a href="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html" title="Google Holiday Logos">special event or Holidays</a>. They have done it since 1999 ---at least, that is the earliest documented year.

This year Olympic Games are not an exception. <a href="http://www.google.com/doodle8.html" title="2004 Summer Olympics Doodle">Google Doodle VIII</a> celebrates the <a href="http://www.athens2004.com/" title="Official 2004 Olympic Games site">2004 Olympic Games</a> in Athens. Below is a local cache of them (I will keep adding them until the Olympics are over). I hope I will not get into trouble for doing so.

I have changed my mind. To see the <a href="http://www.google.com/doodle8.html" title="2004 Summer Olympics Doodle">Google Doodle VIII</a>, simply go to their <a href="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html" title="Google Holiday Logos">Holiday Logos</a> page.
