I have seeing an increasing amount of weblogs that are, either running <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" title="Google AdSense">Google AdSense</a> to make money or asking for donations. Does that works? I mean, does Google AdSense can be enough for someone to actually make a living out if it? And, on a related token, would the amount of "donations" add up enough to pay the rent? I am curious.

On politics. I am a republican although I am not sure if I will vote like so on the next Presidential elections. I am not liking any of the candidates of the alternatives parties neither. Will see; I am afraid that, regardless whom I will vote for, it will make no difference. That's the way politics are.

To further add to this, already very disorganised entry, I upgraded the <a href="http://www.isc.org/" title="ISC Consortium">DHCP</a> server today. Nice!
