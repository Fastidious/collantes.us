![St. Augustine Fort](/resources/2011-03-12-st-augustine.jpg#full "St. Augustine Fort")

Yesterday I went with Kent and classmates to [St. Augustine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida), the oldest continuously occupied European established city and port in the continental United States.

It was a great trip, we learned a lot, we saw a lot, it was cold, we came home tired. We will return... one day. The end.
