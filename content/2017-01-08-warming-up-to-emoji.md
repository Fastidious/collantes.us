No long ago I wrote that [I loathed Emoji](/2015/09/18/i-loathe-emoji/). My main grumble was their usage abuse, and, especially, the overuse of "smilies."

Since Apple's iOS 10, I have been warming up to them, but it wasn't until I came across [Mu-An](http://muan.co/) that they really started to captivate me. She uses them, sparingly, but with such taste! A few of [her repositories](https://github.com/muan/) exclusively deal with Emoji as well. Thus, this post is to correct myself: I don't loathe Emoji. I actually like them quite a bit.

It all comes down to how they are used. :smile_cat:
