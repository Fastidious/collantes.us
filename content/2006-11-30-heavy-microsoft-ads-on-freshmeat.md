<a href="http://freshmeat.net/" title="Freshmeat" alt="Freshmeat">Freshmeat</a> is, in their own words, "the first stop for Linux users hunting for the software they need for work or play." and it also "offers a variety of original content on technical, political, and social aspects of software and programming, written by both Freshmeat readers and Free Software luminaries."

I have been very surprised to see, more and more, Microsoft ads on Freshmeat. All over the place. Quite often. Freshmeat lists thousands of applications, "[...] preferably released under an open source license [...]" . Microsoft != Open source. In fact, Microsoft considers open source a virus (well, at least Ballmer does). Why an, mainly, open source software repository will sell out like that?

I liked Freshmeat, and Slashdot. They were fresh (no pun intended), innovative. I liked them a lot when both weren't part of the OSTG, which is part of VA Software Corporation. Their decandence started then, somehow.
