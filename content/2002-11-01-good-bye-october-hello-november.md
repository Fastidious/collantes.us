Today was a long day. I went to the dentist in the morning, with no little stress. Even though I has been going to the dentist since I was 5 years old, when I grew older I also grew a fear of them, I do not know why. Got to the dentist at 10:30 AM and, between x-rays and "impressions" (they put like a mold on your mouth to create a replica of your tooth in plastic), explanations and work (a crown), I ended up staying for almost 3 hours. I do have to admit that it is the first time I go to a dentist and I do not feel the anesthetic shots at all. That guy, [Dr. Sipp](http://goo.gl/6MdDd "Dr. Sipp office in Google Maps"), has a pretty "suave" hand and a charming personality. That added to the fact that he is an excellent dentist made all the fear disappear.

I got home around 2:00 PM and, even though I had planned to go to work, I felt still numb and with a coming headache, so I decided to stay home. Took tylenol, went to bed and... voila! ...slept until 5:00 PM.

Wrapping up, today Kent Martin got hurt. He got his index finger caught on a closing door. Thanks God it is not broken, but it hurts him... and us (Kim and I).

Finally, we just came from Blockbuster. We took home "SpiderMan" and I shall post my humble opinion after I see it. And that is about it!

Good night everyone, and nice and safe weekend!
