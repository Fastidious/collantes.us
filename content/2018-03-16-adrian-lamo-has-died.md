[Adrian Lamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo), mostly known as the hacker who broke into several major companies computer networks, and indirectly reported [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning), has died — cause unknown thus far. The news was posted on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16601470), of course, and I found [one the comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16602166) — true or not — left there interesting.

> I had a car, while my friend did not, and Adrian had traveled via transit, so I spent the day with them hopping around town. At one point, we were downtown grabbing food in one of the larger complexes — Adrian breaks off for a second and asks a retail store employee a bunch of questions about working there, saying he was just hired at the cafe. We then ended up going into what was clearly an employee-only area — GUYS WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE WHAT IF WE GET IN TROUBLE OH GOD — we duck into a fire escape, hike up to the upper level where he picks the lock to the door with roof access, and there we are, highest point in the city. After a few minutes of me suggesting that MAYBE we go back down since this was cool BUT REALLY WE SHOULD GO, Adrian told me I'd miss the sunset if I kept worrying.

I did not know at all about him, although his name kind of rings a bell, probably for seeing it while perusing news.
