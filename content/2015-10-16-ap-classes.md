Yesterday (15 October) Kent told me he doesn't want to take AP (Advanced Placement) classes next year. He also told me he might not want to be a neurological surgeon after all, and that he really doesn't know what he will want to be, professionally. We talked more, but the rest of it has no place in here.

Amongst the many feelings I am experiencing, regret is one of them. If only my parents were alive. I can't express with words how very sorry I am for the many bad times I made them go through.
