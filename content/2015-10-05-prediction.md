Next year we will have our Presidential Elections. Everyone knows that, of course, because the politicians have been campaining for almost a year now.

Below is the name of a file with my winner's prediction on the United States 2016 Presidential Elections written on it. It is a hash algorithm of a file containing a sentence with my prediction. I will refer to this post the day after elections, as the results are known.
