From Twitter:

> The most amazing thing about the Trump presidency is that itâ€™s made GWB look like a [reasonably intelligent person](https://t.co/yNxi8Vyzck).

And from The New York Times:

> Former President George W. Bush said Monday "we all need answers" on the extent of contact between President Donald Trump's team and the Russian government, and didn't rule out the idea that a special prosecutor could be necessary to lead an investigation.
> 
> The Republican also defended the media's role in keeping world leaders in check, noting that "power can be addictive," and warned against immigration policies that could alienate Muslims.
