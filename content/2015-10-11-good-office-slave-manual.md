Yegor [Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html) has a few tips---a short manual, per se---to help us be good office slaves.

> **Don't Nag**. No matter what is happening, you should never criticize your direct manager. The boss is always right. Everything else may be wrong â€” the situation, colleagues, suppliers, computers, the CEO, investors, the market, or the weather, but not the boss you directly report to. The word of this person is the law. The boss is the god. Ideally, you should be the prophet. No matter what the boss says, you deliver it to others. And you must look like you sincerely believe that it's right.

You should go and [read](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html) the entire *manual*.
