It's almost time to say goodbye to 2006 and welcome 2007. This will be -- I think -- my last entry of the year. A few has happened to the Collantes' family in 2006, but the most important thing is that we have kept together, and that we have being blessed in many ways. Kent Martin has brought joy to our lives, so much joy we did not know existed. He is the main reason I love life. He and my wife, Kim.

To all -- those who might read and those passing by (including bots and all)-- ... Merry Christmas and Happy New 2007!
