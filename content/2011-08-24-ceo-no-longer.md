Steve Jobs "[resigns](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-chief-executive/?pagemode=print)" as Apple's C.E.O.

> "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know," Mr. Jobs wrote. "Unfortunately, that day has come."

The world needs more Steve Jobs. He will be missed. Get better Steve!
