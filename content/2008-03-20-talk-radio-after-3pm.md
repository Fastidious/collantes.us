I used to listen to talk radio after 3PM. I listened at the Sean Hannity show, on WDBO 580AM. I just realized yesterday his 'show' is a radio political --and biased-- version of "The Jerry Springer" show. Full of junk, inaccuracies, lies sprinkled with some trues, repetitive. I should have stopped at junk.

And I listened for the entertainment, for the laugh it gives every once in a while, and as a background noise on my way home. But still, garbage. I will not more listen to it. Just grew tired of, well, it's daily junk.
