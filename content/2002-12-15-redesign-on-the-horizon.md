Pretty soon I will be redesigning. I am not sure what I will do yet, but the main site will change. Additionally, I will be adding an extra blog using MT (Movable Type).

On the main site I am not sure whether to go simplistic or zeldmanian, but changes are due, since I am also changing the way I have been writing lately. The domain Collantes.US will become the echo of my thoughts on technology, science, religion, politics and everything else in between. Stay tuned, if you want. Or better yet, if you can. I dare you.
