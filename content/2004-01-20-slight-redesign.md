Slight redesign is in progress. It may span several days before it is finished but, as everything else, will get there, where I wanted it to be :-) I have been meaning to add a "side bar" for <a href="/2003/09/20/yet-more-changes/" title="I talk about that on this entry.">quite</a> a <a href="/2003/11/22/a-moment-in-time/" title="And on this one too.">while</a> and today was the day.

At home today, tired. Kent sleeps. Good. Will come back, as soon as time permits. Oh boy, this post is going to be short... Wait, I hear noises. He is awake! Later!

KM is sick. He has fever, 100.1 F. He also hasn't poop in three days neither. It hurted me to give him a suppository today... and still it is a no go...
