This one is worth [documenting](http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-two-child-policy-and-the-fatal-conceit-1446157377), as it doesn't happen every day. As a matter of fact, it hasn't happened for over [three decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).

> "It is the latest twist in the most ambitious and ruthless social-engineering program ever undertaken by a modern state: Beijing announced Thursday that the Chinese Communist Party will officially abandon its one-child policy. Yet it has no plans to relinquish authority over its subjectsâ€™ birth patterns; rather, Beijing has simply changed the ration. Now two children per family will be permitted."

And from one of [my favorites](http://www.nytimes.com/):

> "China said Thursday it would allow all married couples to have two children, signaling the end after 35 years to its drastic and unpopular "one-child" policy that has been blamed for skewing the gender balance, forcing women into unwanted abortions and bringing about a rapidly aging workforce.""
