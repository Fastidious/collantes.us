There is a flu strain going around. I am not sure of how vast its geographic coverage will be, I just know I caught a drop --or a bucket-- of it here in Orlando, Central Florida.

Now this sucker is not like any other. At least for me it isn't. This one blocks your nose and lungs and converts you into a phlegm dispenser machine. It gives you pain in all your joins (joins, not loins!), head and eyes. It will take your appetite away, it will give you flatulence. It will not let you sleep and it will bother you while sitting. It will make your life miserable like you never being before. And it will linger. Medicines you ask? None will be enough to battle this one, none did anything for me.

Beware of this sucker! I feel miserable.
