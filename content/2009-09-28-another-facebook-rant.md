This one will be short, Twitter style... almost. A while ago <a href="/2009/09/04/facebook-and-openid-caching/">I wrote</a> about how Facebook has cached my OpenID credentials (wrong ones) and it was refusing to clear them after a few days. Well, twenty five (that is 25) days after, Facebook is still insisting on going to the wrong place, when I enter <code>/bits/</code> as my OpenID on my "Settings <strong>&rarr;</strong> Account Settings <strong>&rarr;</strong> Linked Accounts <strong>&rarr;</strong> OpenID...".

Now isn't that the ultimate imbecility, or what?
