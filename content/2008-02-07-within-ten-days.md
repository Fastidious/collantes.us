The key words here are "within ten business days". Ten "business" days. A confirmation <strong>email</strong>! Do you find that as crazy as I do? What in the world!? If there are using Exchange, and Microsoft web technologies to process this, and it takes as long as ten "business" days, boy, oh boy... I do not want it :-)
