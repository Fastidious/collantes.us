The results of Terri Schiavo's autopsy were released today. BBC News [reported](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4096256.stm "BBC News: No trauma before Terri's collapse"):

> Examiner John Throgmartin said there was no evidence of trauma or strangulation prior to Schiavo's collapse. The autopsy also could not prove that she was suffering from an eating disorder at the time -- her diminished potassium levels at the time could have been affected by emergency treatment. The 41-year-old was found not to have suffered a heart attack or been administered harmful drugs or other substances before her death. She died of dehydration. The report also said her brain was only half its normal size at her death. She was incapable of surviving without her feeding tube, Mr Throgmartin said, adding that she was blind and incapable of thinking, feeling or interacting with her environment. "This damage was irreversible, and no amount of therapy or treatment would have regenerated the massive loss of neurons," he said.

What does that means? Well, that politicians should not put their noses where it doesn't belong, that the whole case went completely out of proportions. It means they should give the poor woman a rest, they should give her ex-husband a rest.
