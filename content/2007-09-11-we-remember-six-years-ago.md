![Twin Towers](/resources/twin_towers.jpg#full "Twin Towers")

Today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" title="September 11th 2001 attacks">six years ago</a>, a group of animals belonging to the human race decided to take away thousands of innocent lives by destroying the Twin Towers (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center">World Trade Center</a>).  Let us not to forget how stupid they were, how criminal they were, how inhuman they were. Let us remember our brothers and sisters who died that day. For me The Towers stand tall. They always will.

September 11th, 2001: We will never forget!
