I am in love with the HTC Hero. I do not have one... yet, still, when thinking on a mobile device I would love to have, the Hero is what comes to mind. And what better song to keep my hopes alive than "Holding out for a Hero", by Bonnie Tyler? So, here it goes!

**Edited:** _Song removed. Did not wanted to get sued for hosting a sound track which copyright might forbid wide audience availability._

Can you feel it?! (smile)
