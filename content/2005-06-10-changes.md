Changes are coming soon. After a couple of years with the same patched interface I am about to <strong>a)</strong> have it right and migrate it to WP 1.5 or <strong>b)</strong> asimilate an existing WP template and start fresh. The advances behind WP 1.5.1 are way too attracting, I am not going to wait any longer.



So, should you tomorrow (or next month) come and find things completely different, do not fret. I am changing things around... <a href="/2003/05/11/things-are-changing-once-again/" title="Things changed back them too...">once again</a>.
