Kent did it again (and we are so happy and proud of him!). The last time he brought home an award was for being on [Principal's list](/2010/06/04/kent-principals-list/). This time he has gotten first place on Elementary School Science Fair. His project was â€œHow is Electricity produced?

Off topic, we need a new camera to replace our aged [PowerShot (Canon PowerShot A640)](/2007/04/12/canon-powershot-a640/). Any [tips?](mailto:david@collantes.us?)
