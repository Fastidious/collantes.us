Yet another long downtime on World of Warcraft, just in the verge of the release of the second major expansion for the game. What a royal mess! You would think Blizzard has it figured out by now, down to a science, but...

I can't imagine how tomorrow, with the expansion release, will be. Not going to "tune in." Instead will let others have the "fun."
