We [bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_(2014–present)). From the [air](http://csis.org/files/publication/100610_AfPakAir.War.Stats.pdf), from the [ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–14)), from afar, from [ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)#Operational_history). And so do [the Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War) now. We target what we believe are [terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror), sometimes we miss. Russians are [doing the same](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/middleeast/russia-syria/) now.

We removed [Saddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), and the [Taliban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#U.S.-led_NATO_invasion_of_Afghanistan.2C_Taliban_overthrow_and_insurgency), just to mention two, and that created---or increased---a mess that continues until today. The Russian's tactic is different, they are targeting both, the terrorists fighting against the "*official*" regime, and those which [we are targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intervention_against_ISIL) as well. The way I see it, *both* seem to be terrorists. Removing Bashar al-Assad---the current Syrian president---right now would just make matters worse. We should know that.

Just this time, I think we should, perhaps, be united with the Russians. That, or completely out of the way. And, above all, we should avoid hypocrisy and sensationalism.
