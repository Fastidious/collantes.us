I thought twice before coming here and write two or three sentences. But sometimes two or three sentences is all you have. I had to do it: <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple</a> Inc., you <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20003477-37.html">rock</a>!

If you want to be a "journalist", act as one. As <a href="http://powazek.com/">Powazek</a> wrote in a <a href="http://twitter.com/fraying/status/12903896617">tweet</a>, "Real journalists don't buy stolen property."
