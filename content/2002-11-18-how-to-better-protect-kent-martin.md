Today was a sad day. I had good times, but my kid felt and badly bruised his lips and that shattered any happy moment I had. I feel like my hands are tied up, because I can not be with him 100% of the time to protect him. I know that even thought I could be with him all the time, I would not be able to protect him against everything. It just hurts me a lot to see him hurting. I wish I could trade and be the one bruised.

I feel tired, so I shall go to sleep. Perhaps I just want to be closed to my baby, and kiss him while he sleeps. How such a little being can take over us --- Kim and I --- so completely?
