This [article](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150915-the-secrets-of-living-to-200-years-old) refers to aging as not being an inevitable fact of life. It goes to describe the marvelous capabilities that some animals have to live, seemingly, forever. Yet, do we really want to? With [all the problems](http://www.howmany.org/big_picture.php) we are having with over population, do we want to pursue the holy grail, and extend life to last hundreds?

We have already "extended" our lives considerably, taking into account that in 1950 the world [average on life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) was 48 years old. I think we should strive to make our current quality of life better, not extend it. That is, live better, no longer. Otherwise we will have to leave our planet and [colonize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_colonization), which [is something](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/science/17tier.html?pagewanted=all) that many argue [we should do](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-419573/Mankind-colonise-planets-survive-says-Hawking.html), regardless.
