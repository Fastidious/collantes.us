"What did you have for lunch?," the father asks while driving home. "Same as usual," he replies. "And that is?" "I just eat random sandwiches of what comes to whim." The father processes that for a bit. "I see." Later, at home, "what's there for homework today?" "No much," he says. "Brush your teeth," he is reminded. Later, in the evening. "Take a shower." A few times.

Just before the father goes to sleep, and sees his bedroom lights on. "What are you doing up so late? Time to sleep!" "I am finishing my homework" is the reply. "But you said it wasn't much!" No reply. "Take a shower. And remember to brush your teeth."
