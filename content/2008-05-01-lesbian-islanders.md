<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7376919.stm">Who has the right to be called Lesbian?</a>

> Campaigners on the Greek island of Lesbos are to go to court in an attempt to stop a gay rights organisation from using the term "lesbian".
> 
> The islanders say that if they are successful they may then start to fight the word lesbian internationally.
> 
> The issue boils down to who has the right to call themselves Lesbians.
> 
> Is it gay women, or the 100,000 people living on Greece's third biggest island ---plus another 250,000 expatriates who originate from Lesbos?

Nothing against homosexuals, but same applies to the word gay. This news made me remember <a href="/2003/08/13/some-of-my-points-of-view/">an old post</a>, and the comments it generated.
