Rob Bennett, head of MSN Entertainment and Video Services, wrote to customers in an email:

> As of August 31, 2008, we will no longer be able to support the retrieval of license keys for the songs you purchased from MSN Music or the authorization of additional computers. You will need to obtain a license key for each of your songs downloaded from MSN Music on any new computer, and you must do so before August 31, 2008. If you attempt to transfer your songs to additional computers after August 31, 2008, those songs will not successfully play.

I really feel bad for those 7 people who bought music through them. If you are one of them, make sure to burn the music you bought into a CD, then rip the CD and there!
