title: The silence of the hacks
---
There is a reason why I subscribed to the [digital edition](https://www.nytimes.com/subscriptions/Multiproduct/lp8HYKU.html?src=3004&campaignId=4XUYF&module=Subscribe-Now&pgtype=Homepage) of *The New York Times*. Its journalists are superb; it is a paper I trust, and have found to be veridical after cross referencing the news they post with other major, equally trusted, news sources.

From yesterday's edition (some emphasis mine):

> The story so far: A foreign dictator *intervened* on behalf of a U.S. presidential candidate — and that candidate **won**. *Close associates* of the new president were *in contact* with the dictator’s espionage officials during the campaign, and his national security adviser was forced out over improper calls to that country’s ambassador — but not until the press reported it; the president *learned about his actions weeks earlier*, but took **no action**.
> 
> Meanwhile, the president seems *oddly solicitous* of the dictator’s interests, and rumors swirl about his personal financial connections to the country in question. Is there anything to those rumors? Nobody knows, in part **because the president refuses to release his tax returns**.
> 
> Maybe there’s nothing wrong here, and it’s all *perfectly innocent*. But if it’s not innocent, it’s *very bad indeed*. So what do Republicans in Congress, who have the power to investigate the situation, believe should be done?
> 
> **Nothing**.

Wow.
