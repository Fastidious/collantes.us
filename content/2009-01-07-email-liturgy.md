I miss the days when emails were written with thought, and care. They were clear, and to the point. There was no HTML in them; replies were perfectly quoted, references were neatly annotated. Emoticons were kept to a minimum, if any.

No one does that anymore... well, not many of us do. I haven't give up, I insist. For me, sending and replying emails is a liturgy.
