BBC News: Nazi crimes archives to set open.

> The 47 million files hold Nazi records of forced labourers, concentration camp victims and political prisoners. They have been used to help people trace their relatives, but were kept closed to protect victims' privacy. Many people felt the files should be opened to historical researchers to ensure the details of the Holocaust (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/genocide/holocaust_overview_01.shtml">Nazis genocide</a>) are not forgotten.

Yes, we must not forget. We need to be reminded daily. We, the most forgetful of the living beings.
