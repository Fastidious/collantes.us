Today we realized that we have lost our camcorder, and with it, all the memories we had since KM was born: from birth until his last birthday, at least. And the pain we feel can't be explained. How could we be so stupid?!

Although we have thoughts, accusing ourselves for lots of things... what sense does it make at this point? Everything is gone, and discussing the why's, what if's and so on will not bring the tapes back. Things will be done differently on regards of the archiving of family memories from now on. Very differently. But...

The only thing we can do is start over. KM has already told me, "You can film me all you want, pap&aacute;", when I explained to him what has happened. And that we shall.
