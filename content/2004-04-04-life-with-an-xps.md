Three weeks ago I finally <a href="/2004/03/12/expect-changes/" title="Expect changes">got motivated</a> &#8212; read Kim gave me an ultimatum &#8212; and sold my two Rolleiflex at eBay. The main purpose of selling them was to buy a digital camera, to replace the one I don't have. But after consideration of:

1. The one I wanted was too expensive.
2. The body did not come with a lens.
3. I barely have time to take pictures.
4. KM has monopolized our home workstation.

I decided that the best investment would be to buy a new workstation. So, a week ago I ordered a Dell Dimension XPS and now I type this from it. The XPS is the one with the blue box on this entry banner image. It is big, with plenty space to grow. Some of its details:

> 3.4 Ghz HT processor with 800 Mhz FSB, 2 Gb of DDR 400 Mhz RAM, 128 Mb DDR ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card, 120 Gb SATA hard drive, 1 Gbps NIC, LCD, 20" DVI.

Needless is to say that the system performs are advertised, and that the applications literally "fly", even with the HT off. Lots of fun!

I guess the camera will have to wait another three years...
