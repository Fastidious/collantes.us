With Dennis --the hurricane, that is-- Florida has had 5 hurricanes in less than a year. And it seems it <em>could</em> get a bit worse.

> <strong>LOXAHATCHEE, FL</strong> -- A wildlife expert in south Florida says turtles may be giving us a sign that the hurricane season ahead is going to be a bad one.
> 
> Lyle Thomas said he's noticed turtles at the edge of the Everglades have nested just about as high as they can in earthen levees.
> 
> Thomas operates Loxahatchee Everglade Tours and said he first noticed the turtles moving higher last year, before four hurricanes hit Florida.
> 
> This year, Thomas said, the nests are even higher than they were last year.  -- <cite><a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/4583160/detail.html" title="Man Says Turtle Nesting Could Be Sign Of Hurricanes To Come">WFTV News</a></cite>
