Not too long ago I was an Internet Explorer fan. The pages I went to looked fine under it, the experience seemed rich. There were no complains. Then I started fiddling with CSS and moving away from tables. I experienced the advantages of the PNG format and I loved it. I experienced functionability I never saw before. I got tired of hearing about major problems and running security updates. I got my eyes opened.

I wonder why it took that long. Perhaps Mozilla Firefox was not that polished back them. Perhaps the times I used it, it crashed on me. Whatever the reason was it kept me blind.  But thanks to IE being so bad I got back on track. The good track.

This site might look odd under some IE. There are minor things that IE refuses to do, which make no sense at all. If you are not using it already, do yourself a favor: <a href="http://www.switch2firefox.com/" title="Switch to Firefox">get Firefox</a>. You could thank me later.
