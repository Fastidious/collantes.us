As if weren't enough my move to WordPress and my internal debacle on what to do with the site design, now I am getting ready to move all domains and files  --physically--  to another <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/catalog/index.php?REF=UHW6Z5PZC5" title="ServerBeach.">hosting company</a>, on a real colocated server (not <a href="http://www.johncompanies.com/" title="John Companies.">VS</a> anymore).

The virtual server I have used until now (and that I still use now, for the time being) served me well, but it is getting old (RH 8.0) and upgrades are not easy to perform. Also it is mighty slow at times, which bothers me quite a bit. So, nothing new. Things will be even messier in a few days. Bear with me.
