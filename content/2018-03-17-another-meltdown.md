Someone is having [another meltdown](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/975163071361683456).

> The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!

:joy:

Now, there is a [background](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/after-mccabe-firing-trump-attacks-fbi-and-his-lawyer-says-russia-probe-must-end/2018/03/17/8250a7f6-29df-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html) for his latest fit. 

Yesterday, 16 March, Jeff Sessions [fired Andrew McCabe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbis-andrew-mccabe-is-fired-a-little-more-than-24-hours-before-he-could-retire/2018/03/16/e055a22a-2895-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html), the FBI deputy director. McCabe, like his former boss, James B. Comey, "kept contemporaneous memos detailing his fraught conversations with the president." That explains it as "the danger for Trump is that those memos could help corroborate McCabe’s witness testimony and become damaging evidence in Mueller’s investigation of whether **Trump has sought to obstruct justice.**" Which in my eyes, based on what I have seeing, and read, he has.
