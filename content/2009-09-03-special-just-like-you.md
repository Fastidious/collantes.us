At first I thought I was special, when I received my first offering of marriage, or the bank transfer to help the widow of some foreign fallen dignitary. Then they kept going, and I knew I was "special", just like everyone else.

Read one of today's emails and smile:

> I am 26 years old, just started work with Central bank of Nigeria, as a scientist and  why i was diong  system maintance . I came across your file which was marked X and your released disk painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate but the fund has not been release to you. The most annoying thing is that they cannot tell you the truth that on no account will they ever release the fund to you, instead they let you spend money unnecessarily. I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this fund to you if you can certify me of my security, and how I can run away from this Nigeria if I do this, because if I don't run away from this country after i make the transfer, I will seriously be in trouble and my life will be in danger.

> You may not understand it because you are not a Nigerian. The only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK we call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy the previous one, punch the computer to reflect in your bank.  I will clean up the tracer and destroy your file, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you. If you are interested.

The part that I found really funny was:

> "[...] You may not understand it because <span class="mark">you are not a Nigerian</span>. The only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK we call it <span class="mark">HD120 GIG</span>. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy the previous one, <span class="mark">punch the computer</span> to reflect in your bank.

The name Linda Jones sounds very Nigerian, don't you think? <strong>Smile</strong>. And the "HARD DISK name? <strong>Wide smile</strong>. And the <em>punching</em> of the computer? <strong>Laughing hard</strong>.
