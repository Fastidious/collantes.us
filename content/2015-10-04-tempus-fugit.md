Time seems to be passing by too fast. Way too fast.

A week starts and then it is over when I blink. Same applies to weekends. It used to be that time seemed to pass quick only when engaged in something. Lately it is the same, whether I am busy or not. I am afraid I will blink again, and I will be gone.

Amongst the many things we can’t control, time is the one that hurts the most, especially as we grow older. I think I am having a [déjà vu](/2003/11/22/a-moment-in-time/).
