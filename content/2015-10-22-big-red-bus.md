"Hi guys, don't forget to donate today!" says the lady with the [oneblood.org](http://www.oneblood.org/) t-shirt. The Big Red Bus parks on campus often, sometimes they seem to be here every day. "We'll give you a t-shirt and a cookie!" She says. That's the price of your donation, but is it?

A typical pint of blood costs [$130-150](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117431&page=1), and sometimes [even more](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-04-05/news/os-blood-cost-anne-chinoda-20100405_1_blood-is-big-business-community-blood-centers-donors). A lucrative business, don't you agree? Yet, [oneblood.org](http://www.oneblood.org/) is [non-profit](http://www.oneblood.org/about/financial-documents.stml).
