And here I am, to wish good byes to 2004 and to greet 2005.  The year 2004 was a heck of a year, too many things to write in just a couple of minutes. Just one true thing, everything we---the Collantes' family---did go through was worth the journey.

So, 2005 starts and with it my often erratic and/or pedantic ramblings. To all a prosperous, peaceful, hopeful, fruitful 2005. Just love one to each other, everything else comes after.
