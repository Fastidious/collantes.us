We have 36 Fahrenheit degrees this morning (2.2&deg; Celsius). That is mighty cold for almost-always warm, sunny Florida. I stressed it to my child yesternight: he must wear warm clothes the next day. Reluctantly he said *"OK"*.

Then comes this morning, and the iMessages exchange look like this:

|        |   																							   |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Child: | "Mama is trying to make me wear an incredibly uncomfortable shirt and is yelling like a siren." |
| Me:    | "Why? What's going on?"   																	   |
| Child: | "She wants me to wear an itchy shirt under the jacket. I will be toasting in class." 		   |
| Me:    | "Calling." 																					   |
| Child: | "OK." 																						   |

I talked to wife, and child. I hope he will be OK, they both be OK. Keeping a calm conversation --- even when there is a rush ---, and trying to use logic accomplishes more than "yelling like a siren." :smile:
