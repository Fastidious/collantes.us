Referring to an <a href="http://news.ebay.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=305980">eBay Press release</a>:

> <a href="http://blog.craigslist.org/2008/04/tainted-love/">Tainted Love</a> -- We are surprised and disappointed by Ebay's unfounded allegations, which came to us out of the blue, without any attempt to engage in a dialogue with us.
> 
> Coming from a shareholder that views craigslist as a prime competitor, filing suit without so much as mentioning these assertions beforehand seems unethical, and hints at ulterior motives.

Why they ever got in business with eBay is beyond my understanding. I hope they will be OK.
