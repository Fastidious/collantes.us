<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/05/barackobama.hillaryclinton">Obama accuses Clinton of using the language of Bush on Iran</a>

> In the sharpest attack, Obama said that Clinton's threat to "totally obliterate" Iran should it attempt a nuclear attack on Israel was inappropriate. "It's not the language we need right now. It's language that's reflective of George Bush," he said.
> 
> Obama said it was time to get away from a foreign policy of "bluster and sabre-rattling and tough talk". He reminded Clinton that she had urged caution in terms of speculating about Iran on the campaign trail "yet a few days before an election she's willing to use that language".
> 
> Obama's comments, made on Meet the Press on NBC, were put to Clinton as she appeared simultaneously on ABC's This Week. She remained unapologetic: "I think we have to be very clear about what we would do. I don't think it's time to equivocate. [Iran has] to know they would face massive retaliation. That is the only way to rein them in."
> 
> Asked by George Stephanopoulos, a former aide to Bill Clinton in the White House, whether she had any regrets over her Iran remarks, she replied: "No, why would I have any regrets?"
 
I specially like <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Clinton_Has_No_Regrets_Concerning_Her_Obliterating_Iran?t=15039246#c15039246">one of Diggers comment</a> to this entry:

> Because you are advocating the wholesale slaughter of 65,875,223 men, women and children (according to the most recent US Government estimate) all but a tiny tiny fraction of whom wouldn't have had anything to do with a decision to attack Israel. You'd be guilty of genocide more than 10 times worse than Hitler. By murdering an entire nation of mostly civilians you'd be guilty of a war crime greater than any in the history of the world. That's why you might consider regretting it you madwoman!

And <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Clinton_Has_No_Regrets_Concerning_Her_Obliterating_Iran?t=15039246#c15056935">this one</a>, my feelings exactly:

> Man, if she wins the Democratic candidacy and the vote comes down between McCain and Clinton, America is *****.
