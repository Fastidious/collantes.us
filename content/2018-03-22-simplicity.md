That is a screenshot of my macOS desktop. It could be simpler, but as it is it does what I need, and want. When I need to use an app, I simply hit command (âŒ˜) space and start typing the app name to launch it. That is, I use [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014).

Wouldn't it be great that iOS could be customized like that too? Preferably it would be a setting, that would allow to turn off the visibility of all, or any app on the phone. Then, to open an app, one would use the [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201285) as well.

Maybe Apple will do something like that, one of these days.
