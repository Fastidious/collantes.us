Well, I got my car back today and it seems to be functioning all right. After this experience the only conclusion I can draw is: definitely, "Holler Mitsubishi" service completely sucks, their Service Manager does not have a slight idea on what customer service is, their mechanics --- or, at least, one of them --- do not know what the heck they are doing... to sum it up: do not take your car there. Trust me. I will wait one or two days, to make sure the car is fine and then I will go back there to give them a piece of my mind. A grievance will be filled as well.

Today was all right. I managed to break a teeth while eating at "Panera Bread", so I guess I will be visiting the dentist real soon. It does not hurt, but the teeth bone is exposed and needs to be taken care of if I do not want to loose that teeth altogether.

Oh boy, am I ready for the weekend or what?
