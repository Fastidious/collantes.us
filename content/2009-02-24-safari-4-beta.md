Safari 4 Beta is out and it is rocking. Apple has adopted (copied) quite a bit from Chrome interface and I have to say the browser looks and behaves awesomely under Windows 7.

But, why bore you with senseless praise? Go <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">download it</a>, and see it for yourself.
