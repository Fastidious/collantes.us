Recently we decided to replace our old Sony little camera, since quite a few photos are going to be taken in the near future, and the poor Cyber-Shot we had really wasn't up to the task. With an under $400 budget, I picked the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canona640/">Canon PowerShot A640</a>, and the picture below is the first one I took, on total automatic mode.

More will come in the near future, as we will have our first real vacation in six years.
