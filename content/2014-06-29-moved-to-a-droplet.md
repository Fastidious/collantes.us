Having wished for a while to run this little site on SSL ---as well as having the freedom to do more things--- which GitHub does not allow, I have finally decided to move to a virtual server of my own. At $5 a month per droplet, [DigitalOcean][1] was the provider of choice.

[DigitalOcean][1] droplets web interface is very clean, simple, responsive and functional. Spawning the server took 54 seconds, and configuring [nginx][2] took 15 minutes, SSL included. I ordered and received my SSL certificate while quickly configuring [nginx][2]; kudos to [Namecheap][3] and [Comodo][4] for a speedy service.
