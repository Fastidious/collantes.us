In the States, looking different and/or having an accent will get you asked "Where are you from?" It doesn't fail, it happens all the time.

Why are we so concerned about knowing someone's country of origin? What difference does it make? If anything, it might be a knowledge we do not want to have. Knowing from where someone is from might spark stereotypical comments and behaviors that would jeopardize an otherwise perfect encounter.

Where am I from? No where, I have no place to call home. Earth, perhaps? Or simply American. That should do it.
