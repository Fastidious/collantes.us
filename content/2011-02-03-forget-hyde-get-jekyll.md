After much thought, and tinkering, I decided to ditch my six year old or so WordPress and start [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html "Blogging like a hacker") with the awesome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll, not Hyde").

I am still getting a few things in place, like making sure **all** entries are properly converted to [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax"), but overall I am liking this. A lot. I do not longer need MySQL, nor PHP. It is a no sweat setup! Some might say, back to basics. Yup.

Anyway, let me know if you find anything broken ---the video links were broken, now fixed!--- and I will tackle it.
