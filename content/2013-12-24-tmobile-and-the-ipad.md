I am not sure about the other mobile telephony providers, but this morning I went to [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.com/) with the intention of buying an [iPad mini](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/). They had only the dark colour in stock, and on 32GB capacity---I was wanting a 16GB. The transaction was almost finished, when I was asked for a telephone number. After stating that I just wanted the iPad, no connection, I was told they could only sell it, if it was with a mobile data plan. Business was lost.

Why? If I am buying an iPad, with a cellular radio set for T-Mobile frequencies, why to enforce activation right on the spot? It is absurd. The [Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/millenia/)[^1], on the other hand, had plenty in all colours, all capacities and no other attachments.

[^1]: I need to add, the Apple Store at Millenia Mall was packed to the point I could barely walk. Apple is selling a lot this holiday season!
