![World Trade Center](/resources/twin_towers.jpg#full "World Trade Center")

Today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" title="September 11th 2001 attacks">three years ago</a>, a group of animals belonging to the human race decided to take away thousands of innocent lives by destroying the Twin Towers (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center">World TradeCenter</a>).  Let us not to forget how stupid they were, how criminal they were, how non human they were. Let us remember our brothers and sisters who died that day. For me The Towers stand tall. They always will.

September 11th, 2001: We will never forget!
