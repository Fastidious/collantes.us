Today we interviewed the first candidate for a job opening we have at work. Everybody, or at least I, was expecting to see a guy. Boy, were we in for a surprise! It just happened to be a girl (chinese nationality), pretty smart, I could say, and charming. Nevertheless, I think she did not get the job, since the language barrier is pretty strong and the position demands fluency.

As you can see, I went to work and not to the dentist. Why? Well, the earliest, emergency appointment that I could get is on October 9th. Can you believe it?! So, I guess I need to be careful with what I eat (probably just keep my diet based on soups and soft stuff) until then.

The deplorable state of my teeth prompts another question: How often do you visit your dentist?
