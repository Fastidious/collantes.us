I have disliked other presidents in the past, for actions taken while they were in the office that I — and many others — considered stupid, crazy, or just plain wrong. My dislike for the current president eclipses any of my previous. I voted for Hillary, and [wrongly](/2016/11/09/i-was-wrong/) [predicted](/2015/10/05/prediction/) that she would win the presidency.

[Today news](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-organization-subpoena-mueller-russia.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur), although perhaps inconsequential, brings joy to an otherwise political nightmare.

> The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.

It seems, though, that is [nothing new](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-organization-subpoenaed-russia-related-documents/story?id=53774529), when it comes to the Trump Organization's investigation.

> The special counsel's investigation has been already looking at other aspects of the Trump Organization's business dealings for months, but this latest sign shows the attention is now turning to Russia-related matters.

Keeping fingers crossed because it is all I can do.
