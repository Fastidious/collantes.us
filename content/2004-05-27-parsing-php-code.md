I am trying to implement a <a href="http://stevarino.com/2004/03/wordpress-hack-php-entries/" title="Stevarino.">little hack</a> that will allow the use of PHP code within posts. Since I am the only "author" here, I do not think that will bring much of a security risk. This post is intended to test this hack.  I will try the following, < ?php echo("This hack has worked"); ?> to see if it does the trick. And here it goes:

This concludes this test.
