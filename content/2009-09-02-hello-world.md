I am starting over. I might "port" back some entries from the old weblog, but that's pretty much it. Right now everything is in state of flux, running on a vanilla WordPress installation with a couple of plugins on. Work will progress as time permits.

There isn't one single reason why I am starting over, but a few. Basically, the old weblog database was "dirty" with entries and rows, and tables from plugins... and god knows what other things (I ran quite a few experiments on that one). It was also designed in a way that made it very hard to just port (odd photos sizes, nasty CSS, etc).

That's pretty much it!
