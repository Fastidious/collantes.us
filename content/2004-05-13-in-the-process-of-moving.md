As you can see, I am in the process of moving from the now defunct <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="Six Apart's Movable Type">Movable Type</a> to the sexy <a href="http://www.wordpress/" title="WordPress">WordPress</a>. Why, you may ask? Well, because I was already <a href="/2004/05/08/gmail-invitations-for-sale/" title="I talk about that here">planning to</a> and because Six Apart has changed to different venues that do not interest me at all. Also, I was getting tired of the lagginess of MT. Well, it is gone, history. Welcome to a dynamic scenario once again (it all started with i42, remember Stevo and Joey?).

It is going to take a while to let the dust settle. It is going to take even longer to get the dust on the air. But the conversion is done, there is no backing down now.
