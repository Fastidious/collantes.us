From the Wall Street Journal:

> North Korea said on Monday it would issue new won currency this week that would in effect lop two zeros off the old ---requiring 1,000-won bills, for example, to be exchanged for 10-won notes with, theoretically, the same buying power.
> 
> It said it would limit the amount of old currency it would accept in exchange, to the equivalent of about $40 worth at unofficial exchange rates.
