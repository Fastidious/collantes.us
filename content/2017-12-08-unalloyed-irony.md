Soon to be ex-Senator [Al Franken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken) announced, on an emotional speech, his resignation yesterday. He is leaving the Senate after been accused of sexual misconduct.

> "I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the [full support of his party](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/roy-moore-donald-trump.html)."

Ironic indeed.
