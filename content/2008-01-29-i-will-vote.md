I will vote today, on Florida's primary elections. I am registered republican and, hence, I can only vote for a running republican. As such, I will vote for Ron Paul. On the elections day, I shall vote for <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a> (I know this implies that he will win the nomination for the Democratic Party. I hope --- and wish --- he does) for President, Democrat.

Please, whatever State you are in, vote as well.
