It's decided, my next machine will be an <a href="http://apple.com/" title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a> computer. Most likely I will end up buying a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="Mac Mini">Mac Mini</a>, although an <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="iMac">iMac</a> is also being considered. Now, who wants a (still under warranty) DELL XPS 630i? It is a Q6600 (quad), with 4GB RAM, 500GB HD, and NVIDIA 9800GT. Comes with Windows 7 Ultimate. Nice machine!
