I have not written for a long time. I am in a state of confussion and change. I feel the urge to redefine life and things around me, I just don't know how and when to start. And that urge to redefine does not relates to this weblog, even though the weblog falls into the category of "things around me."

I am around, I am not dead (Kim and Kent need me). I am trying to find my way.
