Just very recently [I wrote](/2011/02/03/forget-hyde-get-jekyll/) about me moving to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Ruby
static site generator") from WordPress:

> with the awesome [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I also wrote —fairly recently— about [living on a Linode](/2011/01/14/living-on-a-linode/):

> Moved to Linode. Love it, highly recommend it. They reward customers
> that bring referrals, but notice my links do not have any referral
> code. That much I like their product.

Now, not even two months after, I need to publicly admit:

-   [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) isn’t
    good. I hate it! I am going back to WordPress.
-   [Linode](http://linode.com/) is horrible. I have
    decided instead to host with Godaddy.

And that’s that.
