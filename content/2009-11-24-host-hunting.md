I had had all my websites ---this one, and many other test ones, etc---, plus my self-managed DNS on <a href="http://serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> (now part of <a href="http://www.peer1.com/">Peer1</a>) for a very long time. They all reside on a dedicated server, which has, sadly, reached it's end of life (EOL).

Although I can keep it as it is, doing so represents a liability problem, as I will be out of luck, should it decide to fail. The problem is, ServerBeach isn't offering anything right now similar to the server I have, for the amount of money I pay. Hence the dilemma. I need to find a host. One that allows/has:

* Multiple domains hosting
* Multiple MySQL databases
* Complete control of my own DNS
* Ability to compile my own applications and run my own servers (persistent processes)
* Good uptime, enough bandwidth not to have to pay for extra
* One that doesn't oversells
* Decently priced

Any recommendations, please?
