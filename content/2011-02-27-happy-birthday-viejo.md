![Mom and Dad](/resources/2011-02-27-happy-birthday-viejo.jpg#full "Mom and Dad")

Not a day goes by without me thinking of my Dad. Today he would have
being 92 years old.

I still remember him on his 90th birthday, doing push ups using only
three fingers on each hand. I will forever remember the endless stories
he used to tell, and his constant smile. He was the best father a son
can ask for, an example for many. It hurts so very much not to have him
around anymore...!

You are not here anymore, but in our minds you are immortal. Happy
Birthday, mi Viejo!
