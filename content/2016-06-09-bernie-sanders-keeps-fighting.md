Bernie Sanders has had a good run. Yet numbers are pilled against him, and he should know it. After all he said he was "[pretty good in arithmetic](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/740423466592141312)." Hillary has beaten him, and the right and honorable thing for him to do is to call it quits.

> “*If, on November 8th of this year, Hillary Clinton is elected President, we will have only begun to fight*,” Sanders told a packed rally in San Francisco.

I know it is satire, of course. But Bernie's insistency on "[fighting on](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html)" (who, or what I am not really sure anymore) is disappointing.
