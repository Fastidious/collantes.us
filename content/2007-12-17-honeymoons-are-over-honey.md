> Eunice Lopez has been charged with bigamy, accused of marrying 10 men between 2002 and 2006 without divorcing any of them, federal immigration authorities say. The Miami Herald reported Saturday that a records search by the newspaper found seven additional marriages under the bride's name and birth date.
> 
> Lopez arrived in South Florida from Cuba in 2002 and was a legal U.S. resident.
> 
> "I can tell you that none of the individuals she married had any type of residency," said Terry Chavez, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade office of the state attorney.
> 
> Prosecutors say she charged her husbands an unspecified amount to help them secure immigration status and continued asking the men for money long after the wedding, threatening to expose them if they didn't pay.
> 
> Chavez said the state attorney's office began investigating after being tipped off by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
> 
> Lopez was released on $18,000 [^1] bond. Her last known address was in Hialeah, just north of Miami. A telephone listing for her could not be located, and it was not known whether she had an attorney.

[^1]: Of course, I bet she is literally rich. She can afford that and more.
