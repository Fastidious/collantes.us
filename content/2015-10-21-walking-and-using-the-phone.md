Walking around with your head stuck on the phone is like playing the chicken game. The fully aware pedestrian walking in your opposite direction---and on the same path---is forced to play the game. Not as dangerous as [driving](/2006/05/16/do-not-phone-and-drive/) but still very annoying. When you walk, please pay attention, look where you are walking, and leave the phone in your pocket.
