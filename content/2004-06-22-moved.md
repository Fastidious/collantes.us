I have just moved Collantes.US to the new server. DNS is still running on the old one, but you should be seeing the new pages served on the new server Apache. If you see a note at the top asking not to enter a comment, please do so -- that is, do not enter a comment. That server is the old one and it will disappear sooner rather than later.

Expect shaky things around for a brief while. Oh, and I still have Gmail invitations, just in case you might want one. <a href="mailto:david@collantes.us?subject=Gmail Invitations" title="Contact">Get in touch</a> if interested!

<strong class="note_update">Note</strong>

No more Gmail invitations are left. Thanks for your interest!
