As a foreigner, trying to go over a Spelling Bee word list with my kid is nothing less than a challenge. For the both of us. First, there are the words I have never seeing; those I can't pronounce. Second, there are the words I will mispronounce. And third, there are the ones I don't know what they mean.

If you add to that the fact that the kid is learning them, hence bound to make many mistakes... well, yes, a challenge, to put it mildly. It gives me a headache. I will be glad when is over. 26 October can't come fast enough.
