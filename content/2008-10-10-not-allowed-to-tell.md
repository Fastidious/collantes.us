A local bank in front of which I sit quite often has a locked metal box sitting outside the branch. Yesterday my curiosity got sparked when I saw one of the employees (which I greet daily) opening it and taking a canvas bag out of it. When I asked what was the box for, she stopped like frozen, and muttered "_Company doesn't allow me to tell._"

Now, won't you agree with me that such answer was a very silly ---and dangerous!--- one?
