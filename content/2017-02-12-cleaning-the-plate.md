title: Cleaning the plate
---
My wife has always told me, "don't eat everything in your plate, leave something!" It is her believe, and her culture's, that only poor people eats everything, and that if I do so, it will show I am dying of hunger, and thus, poor. If it were so, what's wrong with being poor? Why will I leave food on the plate, food that I really like, to pretend what I am not? I am poor, *poor*, **poor**!

That custom, though, would be an easy one to follow if the food was bad. That's something impossible when wife cooks, or mum. No kidding.
