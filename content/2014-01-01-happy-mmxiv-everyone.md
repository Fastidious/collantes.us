Now that we have gone around the Sun one more time, we simply start doing it again. We don't fool ourselves, it is not by choice. And with this new elliptical orbit we walk into age, which will lead, ultimately, to our demise. It is a simple concept.

Leaving the obvious behind, what's left is to enjoy what we have. To try being nice to others, to the best of our abilities. To go the extra mile to bring the same happiness we want for us to the rest. Not a new year resolution, I don't have those, just aiming to be better.

Happy MMXIV everyone!
