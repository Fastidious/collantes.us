I had had BellSouth Mobility, Cingular Wireless and, now, AT&T. Each and everyone of them rendered a really bad service. In street talk, they have sucked. Now I am at a dilemma: two years contract with AT&T, $150 to break it. On the other hand, I can not receive neither initiate calls from inside my house, neither at work. Most of the times the reception/transmission is really bad, regardless where I am at. So, what should I do? Suffer and pay (whether till the end of the contract or breaking it) or complain and have my problem  fixed or contract voided because of poor services? Has anyone had a similar experience?

That prompts a question: Which cell phone carrier/provider would you choose?
