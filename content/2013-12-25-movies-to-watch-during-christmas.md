Christmas is not the same without watching certain movies. The ones that are always a must for me are "[National Lampoon's European Vacation][1]" and "[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation][2]". As I type this I am getting ready to watch them both. Those are the ones to laugh to tears and have fun. The other favorite one --please don't hate me-- is "[The Sound of Music][3]." There is something about it that just does it for me.

Funnily enough, Clark and family make fun of this one on "[National Lampoon's European Vacation][1]."
