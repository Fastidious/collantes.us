I can't get it out of mind. How a person can be so idiotic? The major of New Orleans, Ray Nagin [said](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/16/AR2006011600925.html), among other things:

> "Surely God is mad at America. He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country"
> 
> [...]
> 
> "Surely he doesn't approve of us being in Iraq under false pretenses."
> 
> [...]
> 
> "But surely he is upset at black America also. We're not taking care of ourselves."
> 
> [...]
> 
> "This city will be chocolate at the end of the day" (meaning that the city will be mainly for black americans.)

All of the above remarks are so idiotic, so imbecile, that I can't understand how or why someone would say something like that. That he is, still, a major boggles my mind.
