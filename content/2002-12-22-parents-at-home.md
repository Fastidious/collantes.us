We have my parents visiting for Christmas and New Year. Kent Martin is already showing his happiness and he remembered my dad. I am glad it is not too cold --- at least for now --- so my parents time is more enjoyable (meaning they will be able to go out with us and such). I have miss them a lot and I am really happy to have them with us for a while. It is curious, but now that I am older --- and a father myself --- I really appreciate what my parents did for me. Money can't buy, not even Mastercard!

A few more days and I will be having some days off. I can't hardly wait...
