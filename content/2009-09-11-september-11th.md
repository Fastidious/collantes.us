We will never forget.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">Today</a>, eight years ago, a group of humans, guided by a political agenda, a deep hatred towards the United States, and a mad religious fanaticism slammed airplanes into the World Trade Center, destroying the Twin Towers, damaging other buildings, and killing almost 3,000 people. A second airplane hit The Pentagon, and a third crashed near Pennsylvania after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of it.

Lets us always remember our brothers and sisters who died that day. Let us also remember that human stupidity is infinite, and that we are our worse enemies.
