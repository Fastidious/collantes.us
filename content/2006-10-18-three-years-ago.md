In light of everything happening in Asia, specifically on the Korean peninsula, I remembered what I wrote <a href="/2003/01/21/nuclear-blackmail-north-korean-style/" title="Nuclear blackmail, Korean style" alt="Nuclear blackmail, Korean style">three years ago</a>, more or less. It took them three years to develop something that can be tested (a bomb), or were they working already on it for a long time and our intelligence was 'asleep'? If it was the first, they could already have a way to deliver it overseas, and if it is the second, we may not even know it.

I really wish my kid would have born in the 80's.
