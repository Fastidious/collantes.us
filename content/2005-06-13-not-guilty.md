This is just news:

> Singer Michael Jackson has been found innocent on all 10 charges of child abuse at the end of his trial.
> 
> The singer strenuously denied the charges of molesting a 13-year-old boy. There were cheers from his fans outside the court as the verdicts were read.
> 
> He was also cleared of giving the child alcohol and conspiring to kidnap him and his family.  -- <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4604027.stm" title="BBC News">BBC News</a>
