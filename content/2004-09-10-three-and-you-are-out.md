There hasn't been that much movement around here --on the weblog, I mean--, since hurricanes have kept us busy during the second half of August and the first of September. First <a href="/2004/08/15/veteran-of-charlie/" title="Veteran of Charley">Charley</a>, then Frances and now Ivan. The stress level of people around is pretty high, so is their worry. There is a saying, you know, "three and you are out!". Everyone I know, whose house or properties have been undamaged, is thinking on that saying.

I will see you all after the hurricane. Oh, on a separate note, I am testing posting to the weblog via a weblog client (Windows based application). Let's see how it comes out.
