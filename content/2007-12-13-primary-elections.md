It is my desire that the U.S. primary elections were available to everyone, to vote for anyone, regardless of the political part affiliation [^1]. In fact, I would not make a requirement to affiliate to a specific party at all.

Why? If I am registered, for example, democrat, but I see that the choices of the Democratic Party are not "presidential" material, then I would like to be able to vote (even at the primaries) for the best of the other party. Am I making any sense?

The upcoming Presidential Elections will be very interesting (they have already been, having started one year --or more-- earlier).

[^1]: Aha! What I want is called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_primary">open primary</a>". Unfortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_primary">Florida primaries are closed</a>.
