A year ago, Kent got his learner's permit. With the help of John, and a little from me, he practiced driving for over 250 hours. A year later — more or less — on 9 March, he got his driver's license, passing the practical test with a 96, out of 100 points, score. And so the asking for a car began.

What car should we get for a 17 year old?  [New](https://www.consumerreports.org/new-cars/best-new-cars-for-teens/), or [used](https://www.consumerreports.org/used-cars/best-used-cars-for-teens/)? We want it to be safe, reliable, one he would like, but one not too expensive. Which will it be? A [Toyota Corolla](https://www.toyota.com/corolla/), a [Corolla IM](https://www.toyota.com/corollaim/)? A [Mazda 3](https://www.mazdausa.com/vehicles/mazda3-sedan)? A [Honda Civic](https://automobiles.honda.com/civic-sedan)? A [Ford Focus](https://shop.ford.com/build/focus/?gnav=vhpnav#/select/)? Today we visited three dealers, Mazda, Honda, and Toyota, to test drive. It was just the beginning, more to follow.
