Love. It really is.

> "Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there --- fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge --- they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."

Last night I was looking for a movie to watch in both, [Netflix][1] and [Amazon Video][2]. I wasn't having much luck, until I came across to this, now veteran, one. I have watched it a few times, but it doesn't get old, specially around this time. So, even though Christmas is now a recent memory, [Love Actually][3] isn't.
