This is, at least for me, completely surreal. It is not only that Trump sacked the FBI director --- who arguably helped him getting elected President --- while he was conducting an investigation on Trump's presidential campaign, but the way he wrote the sacking letter (I emphasised):

> Dear Director Comey:
> 
> I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.
> 
> **While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation**, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.
> 
> It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.
> 
> I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
> 
> Donald J. Trump

Isn't that completely bonkers?
