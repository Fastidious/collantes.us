![Pale dot](/resources/2011-01-27-insignificant.png#full "Insignificant")

Do you see the pale dot on the dark image above? You don't see it? Look carefully, it is there! That [pale dot][1] could be us, Earth; but you pick: Solar System, Milky Way, it doesn't matter. We are that insignificant because of the vastness of the universe we live in. And vastness is an understatement. After all, the universe is infinite.

We might try to explain what is at our noses, but that "what" will always be too insignificant to mean anything more than what is <strong>immediate</strong>. That is why I shake my head and laugh when I read things like this:

> "We've gone back through 96 percent of the life of the universe, to when the universe was only 4 percent of its current age, through 500 million years after the Big Bang [...]"
