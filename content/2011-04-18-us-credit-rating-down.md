It seems our credit “worthiness” (and hence our capabilities to acquired
loans in the future) has diminished:

> S&P maintained its ‘AAA/A-1+’ credit rating on U.S. sovereign debt,
> saying the nation’s “highly diversified” economy and “effective monetary
> policies” have helped support growth.
>
> But the ratings agency lowered its outlook for America’s long-term
> credit rating to “negative” from “stable,” based on the uncertain
> political debate around the nation’s fiscal problems.
>

On this [being in debt up to the head], of course, both parties are to
blame. They seem to be more interested on their own *political*
agendas and *not* on the well being of the country.
