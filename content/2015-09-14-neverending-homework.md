Ever since Kent started the 9th grade he has been having to do an unusual amount, and I mean *really* unusual, of homework. I might be getting too old, but I do not recall having to do that much, so early into high school. It is really messing up his sleeping schedule, and--kind of--mine.

Going to sleep really late each day, and waking up when sun still sleeps is wearing me out too.
