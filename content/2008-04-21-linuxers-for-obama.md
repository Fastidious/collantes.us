> <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/main/LinuxersForObama">Linuxers for Obama</a> -- LinuxersForObama is a campaign for all Free and Open Source Software advocates to contribute to the Obama campaign. Sorry for the shorthand "LinuxForObama", I know it should have been "FLOSSGNUX11BSDApacheMySQLForObama", but I went for short and simple.

> Hopefully team LinuxForObama can do some nice fund raising for Obama and we can settle once and for all the argument about which operating system is the best.

I just donated a bit. I have never, ever done anything like this. I have been pondering, and thinking on doing this time, until this morning when <a href="http://george.tsiokos.com/">George</a> sent me this link through <a href="http://talk.google.com/">GTalk</a>.

Do your little bit too, please. Click on the link, donate! Alternatively, you could <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Linuxers_for_Obama">Digg it</a>.
