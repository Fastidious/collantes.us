I am finding little to talk about lately, and that is keeping things here rather quiet. It is not only that I do not have much to write, but that when the desire arrives it gets lost in translation, mostly because of the way I have decided to handle this little space of mine. The short burts of thoughts are almost tweet alike, but over 140 characters. Twitter then, sometimes, doesn't cut it.

Instead of simply abruptly stopping, I will say that I am pausing. Pausing until something comes along.
