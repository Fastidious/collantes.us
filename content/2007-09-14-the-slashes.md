Lots of people do not get it. Lots of businesses and governmental institutions do not get it. Yesterday my call to the Federal Reserve Complain line (I called to complain about them, and their delay on ACH transfers, but there was no option to complain about them, yet, many to complain about others) had it wrong too:

The symbol "/" (without quotes, of course) is a "slash" or "stroke." The symbol "\\" is a "backslash". Please do not invert the names or simply call a slash, backslash. It isn't correct.
