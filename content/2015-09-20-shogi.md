Kent's latest hobby is to play [Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi). That makes me an obligatory player and fan as well since, just like chess, Shogi requires two players. We bought a cheap board from Amazon, but he has already stated that a better quality board and pieces is what he would want for Christmas (yes, he is already planning for it).

The game isn't difficult to play, but I am having an excruciating hard time remembering each piece---labeled with kanji characters---and how they move. Ah, the joys of growing older!
