One of the many things to look forward to each year is, of course, the end of year holidays. Christmas, Festivus, or whatever you call it, the end of December is always a special time. My only complain, and that might be yours too, is that it comes and goes so fast! Kent has finished opening his presents, and somehow it feels "it is all over." But we waited the whole year for this! We stayed up late wrapping gifts, gifts that are now open, and the "magic" gone. It should not be.

I know it is in our minds. The holidays and all. Why can't we make it so it feels like now, the whole year round? What will it take?
