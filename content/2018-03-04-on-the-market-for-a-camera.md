We have gone through quite a few cameras. The very first one we recall was a [Canon EOS D30](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canond30), with an *amazing* 3.2 megapixel --- sarcasm aside, it took amazing photos. After that we had had many Sony Cyber-shots, a Canon [Powershot A640](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canona640/), a couple of Canon [Powershot Gs](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/list/cameras/point-and-shoot), and another bigger Canon, the [EOS 6D](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/dslr/eos-6d). In between we have used the camera that comes with the iPhones, starting with the [iPhone 2G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)).

Now, the iPhone camera isn't too bad, and since we already carry the phone, it also means we carry a camera everywhere we go. Yet, neither wife nor I fully enjoy the photos that come out of it. In a bind, the iPhone camera does a decent job, but when looking for higher resolution, to blow up photos, or when greater details are needed, it simply doesn't cut it. For that we need a dedicated camera. It is that need which have brought us, inexorably, here.

Which camera to buy? We really do not want to spend over $500, but we understand there aren't many good choices at that price range. The [Fujifilm X-A5](http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_a5/) goes for around $600, and it is not really that great. The Canon [EOS M50](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-m-series-digital-cameras/eos-m50-ef-m-15-45mm-is-stm-kit), on the other hand, looks like a very good camera (and we like Canon very much), but it goes for $900. So, decisions, decisions. Which one to get?

We really could use some advise, so if you are reading this, and have one to offer, [please do](mailto:david@collantes.us).
