I have several domains registered at Godaddy. For the ones I care about, I have auto renew enabled. For those I am letting go, I don't. Godaddy gentlemanly reminds me when those about to expire domains are about to do so... four months in advance! The email "reminders" do not cease from there on. And then regular mail (snail mail, that is) starts coming to my mailbox as well.

Don't you get it, Godaddy? I do not want to renew those domains. If I wanted, I would have set auto renew. Please stop sending me emails --you are borderline to spamming--, stop sending me letters at home. Stop getting in my face.
