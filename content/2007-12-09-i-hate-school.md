When your, almost seven years old, son tells you he hates going to school you worry. It is not the first time that KM tells me he doesn't like going to school. He goes to a private, Christian school, and his main complain has always being that he doesn't like to memorize the weekly versicle. I have noticed that this "disliking" normally comes after a weekend, holiday, or similar 'time off school' occasion.

I have talked to him, trying to find out if there are other reasons, but haven't been able to figure out what else, if anything, could be the cause of his aversion to school. For the few out there that might come by, or for the occasional Google visitor... do you have any experience with this? Any tips you could share?
