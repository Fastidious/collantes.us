Back in 5 October 2015, [I wrote a prediction](/2015/10/05/prediction/#:~:text=below,it), which I saved [in a file](/resources/2016-Presidential-Elections-Prediction.txt) for which I posted a hash. I predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the United States presidential elections. Sadly, I was wrong.

I really do not have much else to say. I am sorry.
