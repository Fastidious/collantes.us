Today is Kent Martin's third birthday. Happy Birthday Kent! It is amazing how fast the time passes, it seems it was just yesterday when he was born. In this short three years we have managed to spoil him, but no more than the normal,  when we are talking about the only child of mid-thirdties aged parents. The day before yesterday was mom birthday as well, 77 years old. Happy Birthday mama!

Our long weekend is rapidly reaching to an end and I have the feeling I have not accomplished anything. I guess the very first question that comes to mind is, what was there to be accomplished anyway? After a busy Christmas with family in our house, we had a very quiet, relaxing New Year. And all the holidays anticipation that we had build up throughout the year came to a conclusion in the blink of an eye.

A made a few changes here and I am not done. For starters I have taken away all commenting; I want to go back to where I started. That does not means I will never bring back comments, I just need to think of a better way to do it. I have been using <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/" title="Stock Xchng">Stock Xchng</a> photos and I already feel the need of having a digital camera. <strong>Update:</strong> I forgot to add that as part of the changes around I began bringing into old entries from previous weblogs incarnations.

Kent and Kim are asleep while I type this, but Kent Martin time to wake up is rapidly approaching, so I better go, wash my teeth and wait for his call. In the mean time, I shall think what wonderful, exciting places will I take him today. That itself is a full time job.
