This is the first post. It seems I have started writing occasionally again. I still conserve the old posts, from the previous weblog. Not sure many of them were worth of keeping, but I might browse through them and pick one or two to bring back here.

This time I will keep this simple. Well, as simple as a person with slight [OCD][2] can keep it. I promise, I think. This little site is generated by [Jekyll][3] and hosted on [GitHub][1]. They are both great!
