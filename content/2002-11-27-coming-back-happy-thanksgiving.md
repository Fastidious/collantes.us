Howdy all! Finally coming back on track now. Kid still sick but getting better, pain on my back still there, but feeling hopeful on both fronts.

It is the evening before Thanksgiving and a long weekend is ahead. My parents are coming up to visit on Friday, so I guess it is going to be quite busy. I am back, logs shall flow, as they did before. I have a lot to talk about and I certainly need to come here to upload.

For my fellow Americans, enjoy Thanksgiving, be safe --specially if you are driving. For my international audience, have a nice weekend!!

Ah, Happy Birthday Martin!
