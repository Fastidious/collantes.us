Yes guys and gals, still playing WoW and loving it. Tryggr on Argent Dawn is already at level 48 and things are getting harder. Lots of quests can't no longer be done alone and it is hard to find good players to group.

Soon Blizzard will allow characters moving, from server to server as well as accounts merging. I might decide then to move to another server. I am not sure it is going to be a PvP one, Anthony :-)

I know, you are bored with my babbling about WoW. You will not know <em>exactly</em> what I am talking about until you have try it. Go, give it a try! Then come back and join me on my ramblings... <grin>
