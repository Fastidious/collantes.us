   caption: Lucky two dollars bill.

Someone decided to entice us to fill out a survey, by sending us a "lucky" [two dollars bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_two-dollar_bill) with it. Normally we do not fill out any type of surveys, unless proper remuneration is provided. Two dollars isn't really worth the effort, and normally would not be accepted as a fee. Yet, since there is no way to send it back with assurances it will reach the original sender, we have a small dilemma on hands.

Thus, as the survey is only two pages, and a grand total of five questions, this time---and this time only!---we will abide.
