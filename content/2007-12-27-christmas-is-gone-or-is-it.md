The long whole year wait, for many, comes to an end quite fast. It seems it takes a long time until Christmas arrives, but when it does, it goes away very quickly. "It's not fair", Kim says. Well, I am that type of crazy individual that sings Christmas Carols, listen to Christmas music and lives the "Christmas spirit" pretty much all year round. I have my ups and downs like everyone else, but I refuse to let Christmas be a one day celebration. Give it a try!
