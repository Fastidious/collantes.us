I have not been posting anything in here, and I am afraid it might not happen for a while now. The reason I have been (and will be) away is Wow (<a title="World of Warcraft Web site" href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>). I have been playing WoW for almost a month now and my character has so far reached level 41.

If you are playing WoW, I am on Argent Dawn, RP Server and my main character is Tryggr, a dwarf warrior. Get in touch!
