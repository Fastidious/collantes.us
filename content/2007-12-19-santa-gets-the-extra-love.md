KM believes in Santa. It is that childish fantasy we do not want to spoil quite yet. But the fat guy, with red cheeks, who pilots a sleigh pulled by reindeers,  gets all the extra love --and credits-- for the job we, as parents, do during Christmas time. I challenge Santa to come up with a <a href="http://us.wii.com/" tittle="Nintendo Wii">Wii</a>!
