Standard Time. When I was a child, an old lady I loved as my own grandmother used to tell me this time was "God's time," and that she never changed clocks when everyone else switched to "Daylight Savings Time." I wish I could do the same, unfortunately I am not old enough not to care.

I am [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br0NW9ufUUw) of the [growing](http://kxan.com/2015/05/08/waste-of-time-texas-house-votes-to-keep-daylight-savings/) [group](http://www.businessweek.com/debateroom/archives/2010/11/lets_turn_off_daylight_saving_time.html) that [believes](http://theweek.com/articles/477395/daylight-saving-time-useless) DST (or time changing of any kind) is [worthless](http://gizmodo.com/why-daylight-saving-time-is-pointless-5892438).

On a different topic---but one that I wanted to note for being a first---we did not have not even one door bell last night (Halloween). Our bag of candies remained untouched.
