Just saw the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090848/" title="Clan of the Cave Bear">Clan of the Cave Bear</a> movie, for the first time, on it's entirety. Great movie. Touching; got me a knot on the throat in more than one occasion. I think it is a sad movie, and brought up many memories. Sometimes movies, like music, have that effect. Sometimes it is just us, and how our mind works.
