![](/resources/2010-06-25-the-unthinkable.jpg#full "iPhone 4 line, Millenia Mall - Photo by George Tsiokos")

Yesterday I did the unthinkable. Something I have never done --- nor will I do again --- before. I went very early (03:15) to stand at the Millenia all, to be one of the first (or so I thought) to buy the [iPhone 4](http://www.apple.com/iphone/).

I don't want to write long about something I am more than half way ashamed of. Suffice it to say that I got an iPhone 4 after standing in line for 14 hours (17:15). Never again.

The photo above was taken by [George](http://george.tsiokos.com/), around 11:30, not even half way my day there. Did I say never again?
