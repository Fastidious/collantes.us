Well, this is it. The year 2002, as an aged gentlemen, is giving a clear path to baby 2003. Let us all hope that 2003 will be less violent than it's predecessor. Rumors of war are heard, oh I so much wish there would stay just as rumors...

Peace, understanding, respect, health, prosperity... May the new 2003 bring you everything you wanted on 2002 and you could/did not have... and much more!

Happy 2003 everyone!
