For one reason or another, we have very few pictures on which the three of us are present. Even today, went I tried to snap one I failed. Don't get me wrong, photos we have, but none of them pleases us --Kim-- to put online for the viewing audience (the very small one we have here).

A couple of days ago I took one photo that I decided to put online, because I like they way KM eyes look and because it represents the priority level in our family: kid goes first, then us.

What's the "priority level" in <em>your</em> family?
