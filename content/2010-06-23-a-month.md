![Dixie J. McCoy](/resources/dixie.jpg#full "Dixie J. McCoy")

It has been a month since our Jean passed away. Times flies, yet it seems like it was yesterday. Nor a day has passed by without coming to mind, one way or another. We miss her like we did the first day. I truly dislike Warcraft, but I am keeping her toons alive, and advancing. Somehow playing something she dedicated so much time on, where she had so many good friends, gives me the feeling she still lives. Quiet mornings, though, speak otherwise.
