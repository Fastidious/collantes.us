The overturn of the elections in Spain was driven by several factors. Leftists accused the PP (Popular Party) of lying and one have to assume that socialists voters believed it. Aznar got Spain into a war that was considered by many as non-needed, following an agresive and self-centered ideology.

The truth is that while the war was out of spanish campgrounds everything was limited to talks about veracity of the (war) facts, justice and geostrategy. But for most of the voters, Spain participation on the war was a "low cost" contribution. Until the war came to their backyard.

So, no matter how <a href="http://zerodispance.com/archives/2004/03/15/when_terrorism_works.php" title="When terrorism works">may</a> <a href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/003490.html" title="The Spanish Elections">others</a> <a href="http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/000524/" title="Two and two">speculate</a> about it, the election results cannot be changed... now. I believe the socialists have never brought any good to Spain and they never will. It is bound to change, it happened in the past. We just will have to wait.
