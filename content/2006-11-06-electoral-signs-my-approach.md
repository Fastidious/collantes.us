On every single election "season" I can see a multitude of signs and advertising that often remains until "natural decay" or the city gets them removed, 6 months --or more-- after the elections are over. That really makes me mad. I would make it part of the process of being elected: if you win, you cannot take over office until you clean up all your garbage. And if they don't, a hefty fine gets applied, they get ridiculed and their seat is up for claiming.

This mid-term elections I will not only vote for the less liar of the candidates, but for the one that has none or less signs.
