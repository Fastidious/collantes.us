I have known about this since it was released to the News media, but I haven't comment about it here. I am providing a link to the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html" title="The Secret Downing Street Memo">contents of the Memo</a> (pretty small read, I assure you) as they showed on the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html" title="The Secret Downing Street Memo">Times Online on May 1st, 2005</a>. Draw your conclusions.  I just want to quote a few parts of it. The document itself says it all, really.

> ...C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. **Military action** was now seen as **inevitable**. **Bush wanted** to remove Saddam, through military action, **justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD**. But the **intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy**. The NSC had **no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm** for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. **There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action**...

> ...No decisions had been taken, but he thought the **most likely timing in US minds for military action** to begin was January, with the timeline **beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections**...

> ...The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. **It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action**, even if the timing was not yet decided. **But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbors, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran**. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force...

Oh boy, oh boy... don't you think?
