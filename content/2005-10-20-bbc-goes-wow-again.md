Although this new "interview" involves only Horde players, the latest BBC article about WoW is awesome and it gives some very sutil but good insides of the game.

> I'ts popularity can be primarily attributed to its accessibility. The game is easy, plain and simple.
> 
> It's more forgiving than most other online role-playing games on the market, and does not take as much dedicated playing or "grinding" to reach the top level. It appeals to a casual market and a broader spectrum of ages.

Tryggr, my main character, has reached level 57 now. A Rogue (dwarf) level 20 and a Paladin (dwarf) level 29 keeps him in company. All still in Argent Dawn. Kent characters, a Priest (night elf) level 10 (Alviss) and an Mage (undead) level 5 (Luciferous) reside on the same server.

What can I say, WoW is awesome! :-)
