Respect others, seek peace, do not be irascible.  Give, help, construct; never the opposite. Turn lemons into lemonade. Hard things to do, most of the time, even more so all the time. We are so recalcitrant by nature!

Yet, our existence would be idyllic if we could manage to, at least, try to do all of the above often.
