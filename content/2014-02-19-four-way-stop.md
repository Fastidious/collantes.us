Drivers in Orlando do not seem to know what to do when they reach a four way stop. It really makes me wonder how were they able to obtain a drivers license without that knowledge, as it is part of [Drivers Handbook][1] (search for "Stop Signs" on that page), the test, and occasionally encountered while driving.

For the record, and in case you live in Orlando, and do not know  what to do on a four-way stop (also known as all-way stop), these are the basics:

* You fully stop, it is a stop sign after all.
* First car to the stop sign goes first, after a full stop.
* If two or more cars reach the stop sign at the same time, the car to your right goes first.

Simple, right? Don't fail at it again! I am looking at you, [Waterford Lakes][2]!
