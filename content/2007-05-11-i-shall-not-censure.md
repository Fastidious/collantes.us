From today on, I shall not censure on this weblog. Any comment left (no spam comments, of course. Who needs those?) will be shown uncensored. I will only mask foul words (just because of my ICRA rating, safe for children), and correct capitalization as needed, but nothing else. I don't remember ever censuring --I don't write enough, really. But now I have taken that idea, if ever was, away from my mind.
