I have moved from Linode (which I will be canceling soon) to [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com/) DNS management (I have all my domains on Namecheap) and [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Transition went well, and painless. It should save me some money.

Nothing wrong with [Linode](http://linode.com/), which I recommend to anyone looking to having their own Virtual Server. Their service rock, and their price is hard to beat. I used their services for a year and totally loved it.
