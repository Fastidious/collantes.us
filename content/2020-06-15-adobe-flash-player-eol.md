After ten years since Steve Jobs expressed his [thoughts on Flash](/2010/04/29/thoughts-on-flash/), effectively banning Flash from ever existing on iOS, Adobe has finally decided to announce that as of 31 December 2020 they will stop distributing, and updating, the Flash Player. Why, they say, they are doing this?

> Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content. Also, the major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Adobe Flash Player). By announcing our business decision in 2017, with three years advance notice, we believed that would allow sufficient time for developers, designers, businesses, and other parties to migrate existing Flash content as needed to new, open standards.

Interesting because, that is, precisely, amongst the things Steve said over ten years ago. It is puzzling that is has taken Adobe this long to finally "execute the sentence."
