For the first time I am working on creating a complete theme here. The last time I had a decent one was back when WordPress 1.5 was around, for which themes weren't implemented as they are now.

No much have been happening in life. I don't have much to tell right now, other that those minor breadcrumbs of life. Actually, I have a few things I want to write, if anything to keep record online of what happened. Those few things involve GoDaddy and Media Temple. But it will be a future topic, not right now.

The changes are mainly aesthetics. I am also making sure everyone knows I am still around. Yes, this is David typing this. No one else could fake my incredibly bad grammar.
