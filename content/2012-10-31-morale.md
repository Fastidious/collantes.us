Last week [I wrote](/2012/10/21/spelling-bee/) about Kent’s Spelling Bee, and how preparing for it was hard for him and I.

Well, the Bee came and went, and I forgot to come back to post the results. He misspelled "*morale*" (he spelled it as "*moral*") and finished in 4th place---for me, it doesn’t make sense, as I have always considered first, second and third place relevant, but fourth?---, which still qualified him to go to the State competition. That, of course, means more practice and hence more pain.
