It seems that for those individuals who do not build their own machines --that is, assemble them-- there will be no choice when it comes to pick their OS.

> 
> By early 2008, Microsoft's contracts with computer makers will require companies to only sell Vista-loaded machines. "The OEM version of XP Professional goes next January," said Frank Luburic, senior ThinkPad product manager for Lenovo. "At that point, they'll have no choice." -- <a href="http://apcmag.com/">APC Magazine</a>

I was expecting to see something like this somewhere around Vista's SP1 or so. I guess I was wrong, unless Vista SP1 is around the corner and we don't know it.
