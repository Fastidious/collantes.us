So, you sign up for a gym, or another service, that gives you a small discount for paying using an automatic scheduled withdraw from your bank's checking account. Things go well for a while, then they go sour—or you simply change your mind—and you want to sever that agreement, to disconnect the link between them and *your* bank account. Guess what? **You can't.** Not through your mobile banking app, nor through a bank's web site,  call, or in-person visit. It is a long process, not a simple action.

Cancelling a scheduled payment is close to impossible. It is 2019, we are preparing to send people to Mars, but this can't be done simply. They can put a stop payment order to one, and/or future payments, but cutting ties?  They can't. In other words, if you set-up scheduled payments with your bank account, you are giving someone unlimited checks, hopefully with a pre-determined set amount.

To revoke authorisation you will need to go through a [series of steps](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-stop-automatic-payments-from-my-bank-account-en-2023/) which conclude with a never-ending monitoring of your account, just in case an unauthorised transfer occurs. Want to fully "break up?" Cancel your bank account, and create a new one. Moral of the story? Don't ever set-up automatic scheduled payments that withdraw funds from your bank account. Never. Ever.

As a side note, if you are a Bank of America (BofA) customer, and **are not** an *Advantage Member*, be prepared to pay $30 for a stop payment order. Luckily for me, I am.
