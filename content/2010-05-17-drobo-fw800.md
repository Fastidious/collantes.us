A <a href="http://www.drobo.com/products/drobo.php" title="Drobo">Drobo</a> FW800 (four bays) is all I want for Christmas. I will settle for one without drives, just the enclosure. I will buy the drives later. Slowly. One at a time.



Please Santa. I know Christmas is far away, I am just giving you time. The device will be used mainly for family photos and videos. It is a good use, for a good device. Could you... make it so?

Not sure if I still want it, based on <a href="http://jan.rychter.com/enblog/2010/6/18/drobo-and-droboshare-a-review.html">more</a> than one <a href="http://www.billstreeter.net/do-not-buy-a-drobo/">review</a> and their associated comments.
