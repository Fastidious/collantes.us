We just came from seeing the movie "[The Martian](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian/)." Minus the obvious, very predictable, Hollywood scenes, the movie was quite alright. It made me wish I could live to see the first few missions to the Red Planet. Being the selfless guy that I am, thought, I would be willing to settle if my child gets to see them instead.

While on the topic of movies, and theaters, it is amazing how expensive it is to see a movie these days. For three tickets we paid $36.39, and that doesn't include concession stand charges. Yikes!
