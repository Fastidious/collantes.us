[Henry Louis Mencken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken) wrote an article on the Baltimore Sun, on 26 July, 1920, that amongst other things read:

> As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.

It seems we have "perfected" democracy. He himself [clairvoyantly recognised it](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/524960640117780480).
