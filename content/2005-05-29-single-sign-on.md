Since I am going to start migrating all my web logins to a single sign on approach (using Chris Zarate <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">SuperGenPass</a>), I think the best way to start is by saving the bookmarklet I will have to use over and over. There is a Greasemonkey version available, which has much more features than this bookmarklet version. I will use the latest because it works with all browsers.

The bookmarklet is: <a href="/resources/t_01.txt">Single Sign on.</a>. Drag and drop it on your bookmarks, lets see if it works (Firefox only). Firefox users can also use a  Greasemonkey script for this. You can read more about that one at the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~jlpoutre/BoT/Javascript/PasswordComposer/" title="Passwd Composer">developer's website</a>.
