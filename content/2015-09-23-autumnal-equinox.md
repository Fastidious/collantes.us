Today marks the beginning of one of my two favorite seasons, Autumn---or Fall, as it is commonly called in the United States. Living in Florida makes the season a very, very mild one, with temperatures still quite high (it will be 90&deg;F today), yet it brings the solid certainty that summer is being left behind.

Join me on celebrating the Autumnal Equinox today, at 04:21 US Eastern time, which is 08:21 UTC. Google is also celebrating it, with a [beautiful doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/first-day-of-fall-2015-northern-hemisphere) and an adorable little squirrel.
