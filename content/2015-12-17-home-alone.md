Just like I did on [18 July, 2014](/2014/07/18/on-braces/), this one is mostly for keeping a record of a first time activity or occasion. This time it was Kent's first home alone day. He is almost 15 years old, and for the first time he spent eight hours home alone, while Kim and I were at work.

Happy "graduation" step, Kent!
