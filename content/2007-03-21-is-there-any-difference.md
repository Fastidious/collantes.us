Is has always amazed me how people or groups of people self segregate, while voicing their concerns about discrimination and inequality.

Some websites have come across lately that really puzzle me. To show a couple, <a href="http://www.blackengineer.com/">Black Engineer</a> and <a href="http://www.black-collegian.com/">The Black Collegian</a>. Why? It doesn't make any sense to me. Are engineers different because of their ethnic background, or because of their field of knowledge? Shouldn't all Colleges teach the same, regardless of the ethnicity of their students? Mechanical Engineer versus Electrical Engineer, both engineers, different fields. Pharmacy College versus Law College, makes sense. Do you know what I mean? Also, I wonder what would it happen and if there would be an uproar if someone decided to create a White Engineer College, magazine, etc. It would be equally stupid, but I am sure it would not last long.

Human immense stupidity do not ceases to amaze me.
