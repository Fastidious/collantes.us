Microsoft launched its free (non open source), cross-platform, [code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) early this year (April, 2015), at its [Build Developer Conference](http://www.buildwindows.com/).

I have been tempted to try it, as I read its file comparison is very nice, its intelliSense, and it's based on the [same platform](https://github.com/atom/electron) as Atom, which [I happen to love](/2015/08/29/using-atom/). Today was *the* day, but as you can see, it is a non-signed OS X application. Microsoft is big enough, and rich enough to afford signing their OS X applications, but they chose not to. Therefore, I am passing. I am sure it's very nice.
