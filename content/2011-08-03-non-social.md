Almost over two years ago I left Facebook. A few months ago I left LinkedIn and Twitter. Two weeks ago I left Google+. I also left Groupon (I don't even know why I ever sign up for that junk!). Next is to leave here. I guess this is my way to [pursuit happiness](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/11/03/the-pursuit-of-happiness).

As Mark weblog is gone[^1] ---perhaps step 9 was, "*Get rid of the weblog*"--- I enumerate what he wrote:

1. Stop buying stuff you don’t need.
2. Pay off all your credit cards.
3. Get rid of all the stuff that doesn’t fit in your house/apartment (storage lockers, etc.).
4. Get rid of all the stuff that doesn’t fit on the first floor of your house (attic, garage, etc.).
5. Get rid of all the stuff that doesn’t fit in one room of your house.
6. Get rid of all the stuff that doesn’t fit in a suitcase.
7. Get rid of all the stuff that doesn’t fit in a backpack.
8. Get rid of the backpack.
